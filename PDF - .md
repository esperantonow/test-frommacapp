### Luggage Restrictions  

Now that Cuban flights from the United States are offered through regular service on major U.S. carriers, the luggage restrictions are the same as they are for all international travel: you may check bags (for an additional fee, depending on the carrier), and keep with you one carry-on and one personal item. Please refer to your carrier’s terms and conditions for additional questions about that. As a general rule, we recommend that all travelers include prescription medications, travel documents, passport, and a change of clothes in their carry-on luggage. It is not necessary to wrap luggage unless it’s your preference - there are relatively few cases of bags being tampered with or lost at José Martī, but we encourage travelers to exercise normal caution. As noted on your Arrival Instructions, reclaiming luggage in Cuba can sometimes take a bit longer than it does elsewhere. If you’re able to avoid checking bags, we encourage you to do so.

### What Not to Pack  

Please see the attached Packing List for a full rundown. Beyond those recommendations, here are the items that we suggest you consider leaving at home:

#### Professional video/audio equipment
> Travelers to Cuba are permitted to bring consumer video cameras, SLRs, and other small electronics like laptops, tablets, and smartphones. However, professional equipment (both video and sound) are subject to authorization from the Cuban government, and we do not recommend packing them. All satellite phone/internet equipment is strictly prohibited.

#### Large Gifts
> Bringing items to be given to the Cuban people are subject to a license issued by the State Department, and strictly speaking Americans traveling under a People-to-People license are forbidden from making donations. If you would like to make a contribution (of either supplies or funds) to one of the many reputable charities working in Cuba, we are happy to facilitate that transfer on a subsequent trip. Details will be sent upon request.

#### Expensive Jewelry
> Cuba enjoys a very low petty crime rate, so you may travel with confidence that your expensive items will be safe as long as you exercise normal caution. Valuables may be stored in the safe at your hotel or private room, but as a general rule we advise our travelers to leave their more expensive items at home - we promise you won’t need them!

### Spending Money  

#### Using Credit Cards  

> Under the new regulations it is now possible for American banking institutions to process credit card transactions from Cuba, but currently the infrastructure does not yet exist to support that regulatory change. We recommend that American travelers plan to conduct all transactions in cash, and not attempt to access their accounts with U.S. banks either by ATMs or through online platforms. Many banks have automatic systems to place automatic holds on requests coming from Cuban IP addresses, and unfreezing blocked accounts can be a very unpleasant process. **It is also our recommendation that you avoid using the word “Cuba” in the memo line of any financial transactions related to this trip: wire transfers, Venmo/Paypal requests, etc. Though there are no rules against sending funds related to your program, most financial institutions have exceedingly strict compliance regulations about all transactions involving Cuba.** To avoid a potential freeze/block of your account and a lengthy process required to complete the transaction, we encourage you to avoid all mentions that might trigger these automatic mechanisms.

#### Types of Currency  

>There are two currencies currently used in Cuba: the peso cubano (CUP) and the peso convertible (CUC). As a foreign traveler, you will only be using the CUC (which many Cubans pronounce ‘kook’), converting at .87 to the US dollar. Foreign currency can be changed upon arrival at the airport, and at other locations throughout Havana.  The CUC and US dollar are exchanged at a fixed rate, and subject to a 13% tax from the Cuban government (meaning that $100 USD will always convert to $87 CUC). However, foreign currencies are not subject to this tax, and it is usually possible to secure a more favorable rate of exchange by first converting your dollars to Canadian dollars or Euros before arriving in Havana. Assuming that you are able to secure a favorable exchange rate from your bank or another financial institution, it’s possible to secure an exchange rate closer to .93-.96 by converting to a third currency first. More details about this can be provided upon request. Please note that it is illegal to conduct transactions in U.S. dollars in Cuba, and you will normally be expected to pay in CUCs. 

### How Much to Bring  

You should plan to bring enough money to cover all meals and expenses not included in the program rate. A good rule of thumb is $35-40 per person for lunches, and $40-60 per person for dinners, depending on alcohol consumption. Taxis cost between $5-10 CUC for destinations inside Havana. Beyond that, you might want to build in extra money for:

#### Rum & Cigars
> As of October 14th, there is no longer a cash limit on the amount of tobacco and alcohol products that may be brought back to the United States from Cuba. A box of Cuban cigars can run anywhere from $100-$300CUC, and rum anywhere from $20-200CUC. Plan accordingly if you wish to buy either of these products!

#### Art
> You may purchase an unlimited amount of art on your trip. You should plan on paying for any piece of art that costs less than $500 in cash, but electronic payment can be arranged if you decide to purchase a more expensive piece).

#### Souvenirs
> Truthfully, there’s not a lot of great shopping in Havana, but we’ll make a stop at a local craft market and a few other places where you can buy small items. You might want to bring a little extra for these occasions.

#### Evening Events
> You will be expected to pay for your own drinks and food during evening activities unless otherwise noted on your itinerary.

#### Miscellaneous
> We will have extra funds with us in the event of an emergency, but you should plan on additional funds to cover unanticipated taxi rides, snacks, touring, etc.

#### Tipping
> A 10% tip is a good rule of thumb for all restaurants, taxis, and other services. BPH Cuba will handle tipping for all included meals and activities. All additional tips to guides and drivers are subject to the discretion of each traveler. A tip of $5-10 per person per day for guides and $3-5 per person per day for drivers is considered generous. You may also choose to tip the staff at your casa particular or hotel depending on the quality of service.


### Cash Buyback

It's our strong suggestion that you plan to bring approximately 1.5x to 2x of what you plan on spending. It is not infrequent that travelers decide to purchase pieces of art or souvenirs on this program, we prefer not to lend company funds to our travelers except in the case of an emergency. In an effort to maintain our reserves of cash in Havana, BPH Cuba offers a cash buyback program to our travelers. At the end of the program, we will be happy to purchase all unused currency - USD, CAD, EUR, CUC - and offer a 5% commission on those funds to be repaid by check/wire upon return to the United States. So if you end the trip with $1000USD left over, you may leave that cash with us in Cuba and we will write you a check for $1050 within a week of your return. Not obligatory, but a much better rate than you will get by converting your CUCs back to dollars at the airport!

### Phone & Internet Access  

#### Wi-Fi
> If you are staying in a casa particular, it’s most likely that will not have Wi-Fi connectivity, but we can make stops at one of the major hotels or nearby hotspots during the trip to check email or get on line, depending on your needs. Please let your guide know and we will be happy to accommodate. 1 hour of internet connection costs roughly $4-$8 CUC, depending on where we go. If you are staying in a hotel, you will have access to internet in public spaces, but most likely not within your room — if you have questions about a specific property, let us know! In **We recommend that American travelers not attempt to access their accounts with U.S. banks either by ATMs or through online platforms.** Many banks have automatic systems to place automatic holds on requests coming from Cuban IP addresses, and unfreezing blocked accounts can be a very unpleasant process.  

#### Cell Phones
> It is currently not possible to purchase SIM cards for personal use in Cuba, but most major carriers are now offering international service plans that include Cuba. **Please be advised, however, that most of these plans are exceedingly expensive** - we encourage you to check with your provider to get details about your specific circumstances, but to be careful about your usage to ensure you don’t come home to an expensive phone bill. Unless otherwise noted, all BPH programs include the use of one Cuba-equipped cell phone for use during your program, both to maintain contact with your guide and for use in the event of an emergency (please see our Cell Phone Instructions document for details on dialing in and out of Cuba). Your program rate includes all local calling and a few short international calls to check in with loved ones, but if you anticipate needing to use the phone more than that, please let us know. We are happy to provide additional minutes for a small charge.

#### Emergency Contact
> You will find instructions on how to dial out of Cuba and how friends/family members can contact you during the trip, but our recommendation is to alert loved ones and colleagues/patients that you will be relatively hard to reach during the trip. We will of course assist you in making calls and accessing internet as it is needed during the trip, but you can think of it as a good opportunity to unplug for a week! Also please note that with a few exceptions, we will not have access to Wi-Fi during daily touring, so we recommend downloading all emails and data you think you'll need each morning and evening at the hotel. In the event of an emergency we will assist you in finding a nearby hotspot, as necessary.

### Itinerary Adjustments  

We’ve already made reservations based on the itinerary as it currently stands, but we’re happy to adjust that program during your trip to the best of our ability. The most important part of this trip is your enjoyment! If at any point one or several members of your group would prefer to skip an activity to do something else, we can certainly make that work. Please note that you will be expected to cover the expense of any additional transportation, entrance fees, or other costs associated with added programming.

### Other Questions  

#### How much walking will I be doing?
> That’s up to you! Havana is a wonderful city to see by foot, but you will have access to a car and driver for the entirety of your trip. The walking tour of Old Havana requires about 1.5 miles of walking on cobblestone streets, but we can also to arrange a bicycle taxi for the tour if that presents a problem. For those looking for a more active program, there are many beautiful hikes and walks in Havana and on any of the day trips or overnights that you elect to include. 

#### Can I drink the water?
> There are relatively few reported cases of water-borne illness for travelers in Cuba, but as a precaution we recommend that all travelers on our programs drink only bottled water. Bottles will be provided in both your bedroom and in the van for your use during the program.

#### Is there much crime?
> There is very little crime in Cuba, and travelers may feel free to explore Havana on their own, even after dark. That said, we encourage everyone to exercise normal caution, and avoid areas that are not well-lit or exposed to regular foot traffic.
